# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the difference between tsdown and Rolldown ?

## Why should I use tsdown instead of other bundlers (like tsup, unbuild,...) ?

## Will tsdown support stub mode (similar to unbuild) ?

For various technical and design reasons, we have decided not to support stub mode in tsdown. We recommand using the [watch mode](/zh-CN/guide/watch-mode.md) instead.

You can find more information about this decision in [this Github comment](https://github.com/rolldown/tsdown/pull/164#issuecomment-2849720617).
