# Getting Started

:::warning ðŸš§ Beta Software
[Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) is currently in beta status. While it can already handle most production use cases, there may still be bugs and rough edges. Most notably, the built-in minification feature is still a work in progress.
:::

## Installation

There are several ways to get started with `tsdown`. You can:

- [Manually install](#manual-installation) it as a development dependency in your project.
- Use the [starter templates](#starter-templates) to quickly scaffold a new project.
- Try it online using [StackBlitz](#try-online).

### Manual Installation {#manual-installation}

Install `tsdown` as a development dependency using your preferred package manager:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install -D tsdown
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -D tsdown
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add -D tsdown
```

```sh [bun]
bun add -D tsdown
```

:::

:::tip Compatibility Note
`tsdown` requires Node.js version 18 or higher. Please ensure your development environment meets this requirement before installing. While `tsdown` is primarily tested with Node.js, support for Deno and Bun is experimental and may not work as expected.
:::

### Starter Templates {#starter-templates}

To get started even faster, you can use the [create-tsdown](https://github.com/gugustinette/create-tsdown) CLI, which provides a set of starter templates for building pure TypeScript libraries, as well as frontend libraries like React and Vue.

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm create tsdown@latest
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm create tsdown@latest
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn create tsdown@latest
```

```sh [bun]
bun create tsdown@latest
```

:::

These templates includes ready-to-use configurations and best practices for building, testing and linting TypeScript projects.

### Try Online {#try-online}

You can try tsdown directly in your browser using StackBlitz:

[![tsdown-starter-stackblitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/rolldown/tsdown-starter-stackblitz)

This template is preconfigured for tsdown, so you can experiment and get started quicklyâ€”no local setup required.

## Using the CLI

To verify that `tsdown` is installed correctly, run the following command in your project directory:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/tsdown --version
```

You can also explore the available CLI options and examples with:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/tsdown --help
```

### Your First Bundle

Let's create two source TypeScript files:

```ts [src/index.ts]
import { hello } from './hello.ts'

hello()
```

```ts [src/hello.ts]
export function hello() {
  console.log('Hello tsdown!')
}
```

Next, initialize the `tsdown` configuration file:

```ts [tsdown.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from 'tsdown'

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['./src'],
})
```

Now, run the following command to bundle your code:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/tsdown
```

You should see the bundled output written to `dist/index.mjs`. To verify it works, run the output file:

```sh
node dist/index.mjs
```

You should see the message `Hello tsdown!` printed to the console.

### Using the CLI in npm Scripts

To simplify the command, you can add it to your `package.json` scripts:

```json{5} [package.json]
{
  "name": "my-tsdown-project",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsdown"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "tsdown": "^0.9.0"
  }
}
```

Now, you can build your project with:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Using the Config File

While you can use the CLI directly, it's recommended to use a configuration file for more complex projects. This allows you to define and manage your build settings in a centralized and reusable way.

For more details, refer to the [Config File](../options/config-file.md) documentation.

## Using Plugins

`tsdown` supports plugins to extend its functionality. You can use Rolldown plugins, Unplugin plugins, and most Rollup plugins seamlessly. To use plugins, add them to the `plugins` array in your configuration file. For example:

```ts [tsdown.config.ts]
import SomePlugin from 'some-plugin'
import { defineConfig } from 'tsdown'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [SomePlugin()],
})
```

For more details, refer to the [Plugins](../advanced/plugins.md) documentation.

## Using Watch Mode

You can enable watch mode to automatically rebuild your project whenever files change. This is particularly useful during development to streamline your workflow. Use the `--watch` (or `-w`) option:

```bash
tsdown --watch
```

For more details, refer to the [Watch Mode](../options/watch-mode.md) documentation.
