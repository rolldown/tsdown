# Introduction

**tsdown** is _The Elegant Library Bundler_. Designed with simplicity and speed in mind, it provides a seamless and efficient way to bundle your TypeScript and JavaScript libraries. Whether you're building a small utility or a complex library, `tsdown` empowers you to focus on your code while it handles the bundling process with elegance.

## Why tsdown?

`tsdown` is built on top of [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs), a cutting-edge bundler written in Rust. While Rolldown is a powerful and general-purpose tool, `tsdown` takes it a step further by providing a **complete out-of-the-box solution** for library authors.

### Key Differences Between tsdown and Rolldown

- **Simplified Configuration**: `tsdown` minimizes the need for complex configurations by offering sensible defaults tailored for library development. It provides a streamlined experience, so you can focus on your code rather than the bundling process.
- **Library-Specific Features**: Unlike Rolldown, which is designed as a general-purpose bundler, `tsdown` is optimized specifically for building libraries. It includes features like automatic TypeScript declaration generation and multiple output formats.
- **Future-Ready**: As an **official project of Rolldown**, `tsdown` is deeply integrated into its ecosystem and will continue to evolve alongside it. By leveraging Rolldown's latest advancements, `tsdown` aims to explore new possibilities for library development. Furthermore, `tsdown` is positioned to become the **foundation for [Rolldown Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/rolldown-vite)'s Library Mode**, ensuring a cohesive and robust experience for library authors in the long term.

## Plugin Ecosystem

`tsdown` supports the entire Rolldown plugin ecosystem, making it easy to extend and customize your build process. Additionally, it is compatible with most Rollup plugins, giving you access to a vast library of existing tools.

For more details, refer to the [Plugins](../advanced/plugins.md) documentation.

## What Can It Bundle?

`tsdown` is designed to handle all the essentials for modern library development:

- **TypeScript and JavaScript**: Seamlessly bundle `.ts` and `.js` files with support for modern syntax and features.
- **TypeScript Declarations**: Automatically generate declaration files (`.d.ts`) for your library.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generate `esm`, `cjs`, `iife`, and `umd` bundles to ensure compatibility across different environments.
- **Assets**: Include and process non-code assets like `.json` or `.wasm` files.

With its built-in support for [tree shaking](../options/tree-shaking.md), [minification](../options/minification.md), and [source maps](../options/sourcemap.md), `tsdown` ensures your library is optimized for production.

## Fast and Elegant

`tsdown` is built to be **fast**. Leveraging Rolldown's Rust-based performance, it delivers blazing-fast builds even for large projects. At the same time, it is **elegant**â€”offering a clean and intuitive configuration system that minimizes boilerplate and maximizes productivity.

## Credits

`tsdown` is made possible by the open-source community and the many innovative tools in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem. We extend our gratitude to all contributors and maintainers whose work has laid the foundation for this project.

### Prior Arts

- **Rollup**: Provided the original inspiration for modern JavaScript bundling and a robust plugin system.
- **esbuild**: Demonstrated the power of fast, native bundling and influenced the pursuit of performance in build tools.
- **tsup**: Inspired the out-of-the-box developer experience and many CLI options, as well as some implementation details.
- **unbuild**: Inspired the flexible hooks system now available in tsdown.
- **Rolldown**: Serves as the high-performance, Rust-based core engine that powers tsdown and enables many of its advanced features.
